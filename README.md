# Mini-projects-python
This is a repository that contains the beginners-level python projects I have written, demonstrating some essential python concepts. There are several projects in this repository, which are sharing an art.py file that has all ASCII arts used. All programs were written in the basic python IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment).
